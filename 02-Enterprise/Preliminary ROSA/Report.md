Simulation is a replica of reality that imitates how a system or process works in the real world. Simulation is show off through the use of a VR headset to transport the audience into a different world. Gamification incorporates game-like features into non-game situations, making boring tasks more enjoyable. Augmented reality (AR) displays virtual objects on a real background blending technology with the world. This use of interactive media contributes huge amounts to businesses. In training, simulations create safe practice environments for complex tasks. Gamification of learning or training boosts engagement and retention. AR overlays provide real-time instructions on physical objects. 

Streaming services are like a giant digital library that you can access over the internet, instead of downloading them you can stream them right away. Gaming and the introduction of online gaming lets people connect to other players through the internet, no longer needing friends to be physically with you. Virtual Reality (VR) immerses users in computer-generated worlds through headsets and special effects. VR goes beyond games, with uses in training, design, and even therapy. These innovations improve access to entertainment by allowing you to connect with content from anywhere even if you don't have the things normally considered necessary. All of the above are shown off in detail with my animation, each having their own section with examples of companies in the entertainment space. Within the animation they are all explained and promoted showing off their ability to the access of entertainment.

Specialist apps can be extremely handy for businesses. They are able to keep customers informed with real-time delivery tracking and easy communication between businesses and consumers. Advertising gets smarter with targeted campaigns and interactive elements that grab attention and provide valuable data to enterprises. Communication thrives with seamless collaboration tools and features like live chat that enhance customer service. These digital powerhouses boost efficiency and customer experience across the board. There are also examples of these media systems in large specialist apps such as delivery tracking within DoorDash showing where the driver with your food is and an estimated arrival time to your doorstep.

## Evaluate the performance requirements of hardware for your specific animation.  
To ensure operation of Adobe Animate, your computer must meet specific hardware requirements. The CPU should have a minimum clock speed of 2 GHz to manage the software's needs efficiently. A minimum of 8GB of RAM is essential, though 16GB is recommended for seamless multitasking and smooth animation playback. In terms of storage, you will need at least 4GB for the software installation, with additional space necessary to store animation projects and associated assets.

For display requirements, a resolution of 1024x900 is the bare minimum, but a resolution of 1280x1080 preferred option for better visuals and easier handling of intricate animation details is a higher resolution. Your GPU should support OpenGL version 3.3 or higher to help the CPU render graphics and animations, thus boosting overall performance. An internet connection is also required for software activation, subscription validation, and access to online features, allowing you to receive the latest updates and security patches.

Considering my animation has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, using a monitor with this resolution will give you the best viewing experience. This high-resolution display let’s you to see all the details of my animation clearly, and can allow precise editing throughout the creation process. By adhering to these hardware requirements, you can expect smooth performance and efficient workflow while working with Adobe Animate, leading to an optimal animation creation and editing experience.

## Explain how interactive media systems can support creative processes. 
#### Describe how this relates to your animation project. 
Including comment on the following 
- sandbox gaming 
- social media 
- digital creative commons 

Creative systems are supported and improved through a innovation and user engagement. Sandbox gaming exemplifies this beautifully. Unlike traditional games with linear narratives, sandbox games provide players with the freedom to explore vast, open worlds and interact with them in a non-linear fashion. This boundless environment fosters immense creativity. Players are empowered to build and explore whatever their imaginations conjure, leading to the creation of structures, stories, and experiences that might never have been conceived before. 

Social media further enhances this creative ecosystem by providing a platform for sharing these creations and seeking valuable critiques. The ability to upload and share content, ideas, and creations not only allows for the publishing of one's work but also sparks an exchange of inspiration and knowledge. By engaging with the work of others, creators gain new perspectives, identify potential improvements, and discover entirely new avenues for exploration. This interactive loop fuels the creative process, pushing individuals and communities to constantly evolve and refine their craft. 

Additionally, the digital creative commons plays a crucial role in promoting this exchange. By establishing a framework for copyright-protected sharing, the creative commons ensures that creators retain ownership of their work while allowing others to access, adapt, and build upon it. This fosters a collaborative environment where ideas can flourish and innovation can reach new heights. In essence, the interactions between sandbox games, social media, and the digital creative commons creates a fertile ground for creativity, nurturing the birth of ground-breaking ideas and fostering a community of passionate creators.

Within my animation, social media and sandbox games are displayed. Social media apps are displayed within the animation showcasing their ability to fuel the creative process, sandbox games are also showcased introducing Minecraft a well known open world video game, a type of sandbox gaming. Minecraft is displayed in a positive light showing it’s creative possibilities and possibly persuading audiences to use sandbox gaming for creative mechanisms.

## Examine how human behaviour may be influenced by interactive media, including opportunities for people with disabilities to explore and participate in their environment. 
#### How does this relate to your animation project?  
Human behaviour can be heavily influenced by interactive media, such is why there is a large market for advertising. Having a content creator endorse a product might make you trust them more or at least know of the company and their products. This influence can be positive, with educational channels sparking curiosity and igniting new passions. However, it can also be manipulative, with carefully curated content shaping opinions and desires.

Interactive media presents opportunities for people with disabilities. Interactive media offers a chance to break down these barriers. Platforms are designed with accessibility features in mind, allowing people with visual or hearing impairments to consume content on an equal footing. Similarly, games with customizable controls or voice commands can open up immersive worlds to those with physical limitations.

Furthermore, interactive media fosters a sense of agency for users with disabilities. Social media platforms provide a voice that transcends geographical limitations, allowing individuals to connect with communities and share their experiences. Educational tools can be tailored to individual learning paces and styles, empowering users with learning disabilities or cognitive impairments to grasp concepts at their own rhythm. In essence, interactive media can dismantle barriers to exploration and participation in the environment, fostering a more inclusive and enriched world for all.

There is no real relation between opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in environments online and my animation. While my animation is accessible by anyone and could be easily watched by someone who has disabilities it would also likely be hard to interact with due to its  pre-set pacing. My animation does relate to how human  behaviour may be influenced through interactive media as the animation showcases multiple different brands and pieces of software. As discusses in the first paragraph this showcasing can influence audiences to look at these products and know of their name.

## Investigate how the following digital marketing techniques could be used in your animation:  
Including the following concepts
- guided choice (nudging)
- default settings, including cookies
- autofill
- pop-ups promoting online shopping
Guided choice can be used in my animation by pushing the user towards using the interactive media showcased within the animation making the user think about all the benefits of the applications. Default settings often include large amounts of tracking the company wants to be enabled and cookies help the company keep track of users. Auto-fill creates a faster and easier web-viewing experience letting browsers collect, remember, and fill out forms for you. Pop-ups promoting online shopping can increase a users chance to impulse buy a product or think about what you are advertising, pop-ups can also create accidental clicks driving more users to your web-page. In my animation only guided choice is used likely pushing anyone watching to check out the things detailed within, default setting and autofill aren't used in the animation as there is no data or settings that can be changed. Pop-ups are also not included as it's simply not something I put into the animation and there are no ads running in the animation.
