Well-being 
Head in hands at table
Voices in head maybe me laying against walls
Ring tone grows louder and snaps me back to reality
Twist at the end someone getting his attention because he's zoning out

### Scene 1:
Long shot moving in 
Head down
Cut black 
### Scene 2:
Jump forwards
Whispering starts
Close head-down 
### Scene 3:
Eyes pull up 
Camera flips 
Looking to different me
Starts talking down
Look left another me talking down
Pull back a little, three me's talking down
### Scene 4: 

### Scene 5:
**Could either approach physically or call me**

Phone starts to ring
Gets louder 
Reaches to pick up
### Scene 6: 
Eric happy and talking to me
I respond and continue
