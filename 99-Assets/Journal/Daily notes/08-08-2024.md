I thought I should start a journal. 

Today is a Thursday, I went through school completed some math work I was meant to do last week and worked out. 

My school results have been steadily dropping over the last couple months. I don’t now how much I care anymore, my dad plans on enrolling me in an English tuition named A+. The place seems to be Korean but has a handful of friends already going there.

I’m at my dad’s even though it is a weekday, it’s not too bad but just inconvenient because of how far out he is. 

Saturday I have a basketball training program, I really don’t want to go. Talbot injured himself and won’t be able too and I just hate it, I’m so terrible and I feel like everyone there just hates me. 

This feels very negative but I’m somewhat happy that I worked out today, I hope to keep the trend up and start to physically look better. I still wonder if Zara misses me or Kaav likes me.
