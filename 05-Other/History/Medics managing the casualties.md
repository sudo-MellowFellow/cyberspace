TLDR: A triage is created creating a structured system for sorting and transporting sick and wounded. The wounded are then moved along the medical chain via a transport network and first stop is the rear trenches. In the trenched medical staff assess the wounded soldiers, change bandages, and give morphine as a painkiller. Doctors then classify patients based on type of care needed and send them further down the line for treatment.

- Triage (structured sorting of wounded)
- Transport network

The British army developed a complex triage (transport and assignment system for the injured)

Triage is the practice of sorting casualties (sick and wounded people) into categories of priority for treatment, and it's still used in hospitals today.

The wounded were sorted and moved along a medical chain via a transport network that included:
- stretcher bearers
- horse-drawn wagons
- motorised ambulances
- ambulance trains
- canal barges
- hospital ships

Usually located in rear trenches, the battalion's medical officer and other medical staff would:
- assess the wounded soldiers
- change bandages
- give morphine as a painkiller
Then a doctor would:
- classify the patients according to the type of care needed
- send them on further behind the line for more treatment
