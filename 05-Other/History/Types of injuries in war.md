Gas while a weapon which committed terrible injuries was not extremely effective instead being effective at burning the skin and lungs. Gas burned skin and irritated noses, throats, and lungs. It could cause death or paralysis within minutes, killing by asphyxiation. Even if a soldier survived a gas attack many of these injuries were life long with their lungs never recovering.

By world war 1 there was severe fundamental improvements in medical care, resulting in dramatically improved care of battlefield wounds. First, the developments of effective local and general anesthesia allowed surgeons to take as much time as they need to repair wounds. Second, the recognition that bacterial contamination causes post-operative (after surgery) infections prompted the development of aseptic surgery, in which everything used during an operation is sterilized. Third, debridement, which is complete cleaning of the wound including excision of dead tissue, became standard surgical treatment.
