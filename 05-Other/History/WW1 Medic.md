**Task**
You are an Australian medic on the Western Front. Your task is to write a journal entry that reflects the nature of fighting in battle during World War One. 

While Australians back at home have been able to read the brief newspaper snippets detailing the battle, they really need a detailed account of war experiences. You are responsible for conveying a sense of the battlefield to the families and friends of soldiers back at home. Your account should describe:
- conditions of a medic in the trenches
- description of the types of injuries sustained during battle
- explain how medics have tried to  manage the number of casualties (injuries)
- assessment of how successful they have been in managing the circumstances
- general sentiment amongst the medical personnel
- you can use an existing story/event to enhance your entry

This is a private journal entry, so no censorship of material is necessary. This goal is for you to accurately communicate how a front line medic may have felt during their time on the western front. Try and include specific historical detail: names, dates, places, events, terms/concepts. 

Before you begin writing your journal entry, you need to spend some time researching. Use the paper provided to you to create a detailing summary of the experiences of medical professionals. Your aim is to have enough knowledge/information that you can write a compelling piece. Here are some articles to get you started. I would expect you to go beyond this:
