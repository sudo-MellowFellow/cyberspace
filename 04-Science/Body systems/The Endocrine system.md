## How do hormones work? 
Hormones are large chemical molecules produced by endocrine glands.
Their role is to act as chemical messengers, in order to regulate key bodily functions.

Hormones are transported in the blood to their **target organ(s)**

This means an endocrine gland can be located a long distance from where the hormone it secretes has an effect.

**Receptors** on the cell membranes of cells in the target organ recognise the hormone. The cells then respond by changing their cellular activity to bring about a particular effect.

# Hormones example: adrenaline 
**Adrenaline** is a hormone secreted by the **adrenal glands**.

The adrenal glands are located just above the **kidneys**.

Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and transported in the circulatory system throughout the body.

Adrenaline targets several parts of the body, including the heart, blood vessels and liver.

## What effect does adrenaline have?
Adrenaline is sometimes called the "fight or flight" hormone.

This is because its role is to prepare the body for action in times of fear or stress. It has several effects, including:
* increasing heart rate
* increasing blood pressure
* increasing blood flow to muscles
* relaxing the airways and increasing breathing rate
* stimulating the liver to convert glycogen to glucose, which is released into the blood to increase blood glucose levels.

## Importance of the endocrine system
The endocrine system coordinates the activity of many different organs and bodily functions.

It plays a key role in **homeostasis**, by enabling cells to alter their activity in response to changes in body conditions.

If the endocrine system does not work properly, it can
