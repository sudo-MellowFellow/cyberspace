## Senses
**Sense organs** are special parts of our body that pick up information from the environment:
+ **Eyes:** vision
+ **Ears:** hearing
+ **Nose:** smell
+ **Tongue:** taste
+ **Skin:** touch
## Receptor cells
Each sense organ contains special cells called **receptor cells.**

These important cells pick up information from the environment.

There are different types of receptor cell, and they can look very different to each other.
# How does the nervous system work?
The nervous system allows organisms to react to their surrounding and coordinate their behaviour.

Information for the environment, also known as a **stimulus**, is detected by receptor cells in the sense organs.

This causes a signal to be sent through nerve cells to the brain or spinal cord, where it is processed.

Another signal is sent to parts of the body that produce an appropriate **response**. These are called **effectors**.
## Motor neurons
+ Carry messages from the CNS to the effectors.
+ Effectors are muscles or glands that puts message into effect
## Sensory neurons
+ Carry messages from the cells in the sense organs to the brain and spinal cord.
+ Effectors are muscles or glands that put the message into effect
# Neurons
+ Between neurons, there are spaces called **synapses.**
+ When nerve impulse reaches the axon terminals at the end of an axon, a **chemical called a neurotransmitter** is released into the synapses.
+ Neurotransmitter carries messages from the axon of one neuron to the dendrites of the next neuron.
+ Dendrites receive the chemical message and sends off an electrical signal.
+ Nerves in our body are made from neurons bundled together.
+ Neurons are covered with an insulating layer called myelin sheath. It insulates the neurons from each other and increases the speed of the nerve impulse
