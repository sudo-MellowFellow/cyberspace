# First line of defence
## Skin
- Provides physical barriers for the pathogen, such as our unbroken skin.
- The skin provides a protective, mechanical barrier against infection due to its layer of keratin which microorganisms cannot penetrate.
- It protects our internal organs and tissue from having direct contact with environmental pathogens.
- The dryness of the skin also prevents growth of pathogens.
## Fluid
- Mucous membranes occur along the alimentary canal, urogenital canal, reproductive tract and respiratory surfaces.
- These membranes produce mucous which traps the pathogens. The mucous contains the antibodies, preventing viruses and bacteria and fungi.
- Tears contain lysosomes that help destroy the cell wall of some organisms
- Saliva can also destroy or inhibit pathogens with lysosomes.
- Urine flushes the lower urinary tract as it is sterile and acidic
## Cilia
- Cilia are like tiny hairs that line the airways and trap pathogens.
- They sweep back and forth to help move pathogens trapped in mucous back up the airways so that they can be coughed up, sneezed out or swallowed.
- Eye lashes are not cilia, but pathogens can also get caught in them and therefore not enter the eyes
## Chemicals
- Chemical barriers provide conditions that are not hospitable for microorganisms.
- The pH of the skin, which is slightly acidic, can prevent the growth of some pathogens.
- The skin secretes salt, which also inhibits bacterial growth.
- The pH in the stomach can destroy many pathogens.
- Acids in the vagina inhibit the growth of fungi and bacteria in the female reproductive tract.
# Second line of defence
- If a pathogen makes it past the first line of defence, it enters the body and triggers the immune response.
- The second line of defence consists of an internal and non-specific type of defence.
- The actual immune response is triggered by an antigen.
- An antigen is a marker protein that is located on the surface of bacteria and viruses or is a part of a toxic molecule (such as venom).
- The body recognises the foreign antigen as ‘non-self’.
- Each pathogen has its own antigen.
## Phagocytosis
- Phagocytes are white blood cells (lymphocytes) that engulf and destroy foreign microorganisms.
- Macrophages are typical phagocytes. They are large, mobile, long living and filled with lysosomes.
## Inflammation
- When a pathogen enters our body, an inflammatory response is triggered by the damaged tissue.
- Blood vessels dilate so that the blood flow is increased to the site of infection. This raises the temperature at the site of infection.
- The increased blood flow brings an increased number of white blood cells and helps contain the infection.
## Cell Death
- Cells at the site of a wound start to die in order to seal off the area and help prevent further infection.
- Programmed cell death is known as apoptosis.
# Third line of defence 
- Third line of defence consists of a specific immune response and is the body’s main immune response.
- It helps the body to build up a resistance and fight long term infections.
- This line of defence comprises of antibodies, T cells, and B cells.
- Antibodies are proteins produced in the lymph that bind to specific antigens and destroy them.
- T cells and B cells are lymphocytes that are activated by the presence of antigens
## Lymph and Lymph Nodes
- Lymph: A clear-to-white fluid made of white blood cells, especially lymphocytes, the cells that attack bacteria in the blood and body tissues
### Lymph nodes:
- Responsible for production and storage of immune cells that help the body fight infection.
- Filter the lymph fluid and remove foreign material such as bacteria and cancer cells.
- When bacteria are recognised in the lymph fluid, the lymph nodes make more infection-fighting white blood cells, causes the nodes to swell. The swollen nodes are sometimes felt in the neck, Under the arms.
## Antibodies
- Antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) are receptor proteins located in the blood plasma ( and other body fluids) that combine and neutralise an antigen.
- They are highly specific for the particular antigen that stimulated their synthesis and release.
- The Antigen-antibody complex activates a series of proteins that destroy the bacteria and release histamine (that attracts phagocytes) that causes an inflammatory response.
### Antibodies can react in a number of ways:
- They can combine with the antigen to cover it’s active site.
- It may dissolve parts of the cell wall.
- It can neutralise the toxins produced by the antigen.
- Immunoglobulin (IgA) causes the bacteria to clump together and become less active so that it can be taken more easily to the lymph.
- It can make the antigen more susceptible to phagocytosis.
## T Cells
- T cells (or T lymphocytes) are types of non-phagocytic white blood cells that produce a ‘cell mediated response’ and destroy antigens.
- They derive from bone marrow stem cells that migrate to the thymus to become T cells. They circulate through the blood, lymph and spleen and are inactive until they come into contact with an antigen.
- The antigen combines with the antibody and activates it to make copies of itself.
- Once activated, some T cells secrete substances that can directly destroy antigens, others cause the bacteria to clump together so they can be taken more easily to the lymph, while others stimulate B cells and macrophages.
- After an infection, some T cells remain in the body as memory cells ready in case a similar infection of the same pathogen occurs.
### Other types 
- Killer T Cells, or Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) secrete chemicals that destroy antigens directly or inhibit replication of viruses, they also enhance macrophage activity. 
- Helper T cells (Th) secrete interleukins (hormone-like messenger chemicals between lymphocytes) which enhance antibody production by B cells and help regulate cytotoxic T cells. 
- HIV infects T4 helper cells which reduces their number and function. 
- Memory T Cells retain the ability to recognise the original invading antigen. Future infections can be dealt with much quicker and more effectively as they produce large numbers of antibodies very quickly.
- Suppressor T Cells help turn off the immune response once the antigen is destroyed and the infection is under control.
## B Cells
- B cells are Third line of defence - white blood cells and provide the ‘antibody mediated’ response. 
- They derive from bone marrow stem cells that stay and develop in the bone marrow and later accumulate in the spleen and lymph nodes. 
- Antigens stimulate the lymphocytes to divide by mitosis to clone themselves. They then differentiate into plasma cells that send antibodies into the blood, or into the memory cells. 
- This usually occurs in the lymph node and causes it to swell when the body is fighting an infection.
## B & T Cell Interaction
- Once an antigen enters the body it is ingested and processed by a macrophage. 
- When engulfing an antigen, macrophages display fragments of the antigen on their outer membrane which B & T cells recognise. 
- They are also both regulated by cytokines (proteins secreted by T cells and macrophages that signal to other cells to initiate the immune response)
- B Cells cannot function without T cells that stimulate them to produce antibodies, and helper T cells induce B cells to divide and produce large numbers of clones

# Vaccination
- Vaccination is the introduction of a less virile or dead pathogen that induces an immune response. 
- B cells produce the antibody to destroy the antigen, and T memory cells develop to prepare the body for future infections. 
- If memory cells decrease in numbers over time, booster vaccinations can be given.
- Vaccinations do not cause the disease as the pathogens are not alive.
