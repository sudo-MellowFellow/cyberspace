**Aim:** To show the movement of atomic bonds through some simple chemical reactions  
# Displacement Reaction (Demonstration only)  
**Equipment:** 
• steel wool  
• copper sulphate solution  
• Safety glasses  
• Beaker  
**Method:**  
1) Put the steel wool into the copper sulphate solution  
2) Record your observations  
**Results:** (describe what you saw)  
**Conclusion:**  
# Precipitation reaction  
**Equipment:**  
• Calcium Nitrate  
• Sodium Carbonate  
• Sodium Chloride  
• Sodium Hydroxide  
• Stirring rod  
• Safety glasses  
• Black reaction plates  
**Method:**  
1) Put 2 drops of calcium nitrate onto each of the dimples of the black plate  
2) Add 2 drops of sodium carbonate to one row of dimples  
3) Using a tooth pick, mix the two chemicals.  
4) Record your observations  
5) Repeat steps 2-4 with sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide  
**Results:**  

| Mixture Calcium Nitrate + | Sodium Carbonate | Sodium Chloride | Sodium Hydroxide |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Precipitate?              | Yes              | No              | A little         |
 
**Conclusion:**
Only some mixes make precipitate, and the amount changes based on what we mixed. The colour of the precipitate can also change.
# Burning magnesium in oxygen  
**Equipment:**  
• Magnesium strip  
• Bunsen burner  
• Safety glasses  
• Metal tongs  
• Matches  
**RISK ASSESSMENT:** Magnesium burns a strong white colour. This is potentially blinding, DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT BURNING MAGNESIUM.  
**Method:**  
1) Describe the initial appearance of the magnesium strip  
2) Ignite the strip using a Bunsen burner (See RISK ASSESSMENT)  
3) When slightly cooled, describe the final appearance of the magnesium strip  
**Results:**  

| Initial description | Final description   |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Very bright rock    | Pieces of white out |

**Conclusion:**
Don’t look at it and probably very hot.
