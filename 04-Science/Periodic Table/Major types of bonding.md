# Ionic Bonding
- forms ionic **compounds**
- transfer of e- (electrons)
>The transfer of electrons between two atoms, which are metal and non-metal.
>This is due to the metal trying to stabilize getting rid of valence electrons in an unfilled ring.

# Covalent Bonding
- Forms molecules
- Sharing e-

# Chemical Bonding
- A bond results from the attraction of nuclei for electrons
	- All atoms are trying to achieve a **stable octet**. (Stable amount of electrons in the valence shell)
	- Atoms try to stabilize their valence shell, lose or gain electrons to try round up or down to 8 or 0
