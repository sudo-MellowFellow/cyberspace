# Electricity at the Atomic Level
![[Atomic Shell.png]]
## Components of an Atom
### Nucleus
The centre portion of an atom containing the protons and neutrons
### Protons
Positively charged atomic particles
### Neutrons 
Uncharged atomic particles
### Electrons
Negatively charged particles
### Electron Orbitals
Orbits in which electrons move around the nucleus of an atom.

The *flow* of electric charge
- measured in **AMPERES** (A)

**Conventional Current** assumes that current flows out of the positive side of the battery, through the circuit, and back to the negative side of the battery. This was the convention established when electricity was first discovered, but it is incorrect!

**Electron Flow** is what actually happens. The electrons flow out of the negative side of the battery, through the circuit, and back to the positive side of the battery.

### Types of current
#### DC aka direct current
1. Current flows in one direction
2. Usually in batteries, solar cells
> Easy to store
#### AC aka alternating current
1. Flows in alternating direction
2. Mainly used to transport electricity over longer distances
