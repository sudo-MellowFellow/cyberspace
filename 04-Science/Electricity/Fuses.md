_3. Why would different appliances need different sized fuses?_

_4. Design a practical to_ _see how fuses of various thickness affect their maximum_ _allowable current_

_5. Is this method a fair test? Explain any errors and how you_ _could improve this experiment._

_6. Using the particle theory of matter, explain why the steel wool_ _melts when there is a high enough current._
