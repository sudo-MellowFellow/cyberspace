# Conventional current
When electricity was first discovered, it was believed that the particles moving around circuits had a positive charge.
Scientists thought that the particles must be moving from the positive to the negative terminal of a battery as the particles were positive.
Movement of electric charge in this direction is called **conventional current.**

# Electron flow
We now know what these particles are - they are **electrons.**
They are negative, so they move away from the negative and towards the positive terminal of a battery. This movement is called **electron flow.**
Some people still think of electricity in terms of conventional current, not electron flow. 
This can be confusing, so it is important to understand the difference between the two.

# Calculating current
V = voltage, I = current, and R = resistance
(I is current as intensity)

## Measuring voltage
**Voltage** (also called **potential difference**) is measured using a device called a voltmeter. The unit of measurement for potential difference is the volt, which has the symbol V. In a circuit diagram, a voltmeter is given the symbol V.

When measuring the voltage across a component, the voltmeter is always connected in **parallel** with (or across) the component.

This is still a series circuit, as the voltmeter does not affect the circuit.

The voltage supplied by the battery is **shared** between all the components in a series circuit.

# What affects the size of the current?
Current is a measure of the rate of flow of electric charge through a circuit. A large current means a faster rate of flow.

* Current can be changed by increasing or decreasing the **voltage** of the circuit.
* Components in a circuit may reduce the size of the current. This is called **resistance.**
* Resistance is a measure of how hard it is for electrons to move in an electrical circuit.
* All wires and components resist current.

## Fixed resistor
A resistor is a component that opposes the flow of current.
A fixed resistor has a fixed value of resistance. Resistors have different coloured bands which code for the value of resistance.
## Variable resistor
The resistance of a variable resistor (or rheostat) can be changed.
This can be done by adjusting a slider.
A variable resistor is used to control the flow of current.
## Motor
A motor is a machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
The higher the current, the greater the mechanical motion.
## Cell/battery
A cell is a power source with a fixed voltage that enables current to flow.
Two or more cells connected is called a battery.
The battery symbol is made from joining cell symbols together.
## Ammeter
An ammeter is a device that is used to measure current.
Current is measured in **amperes(A).**
An ammeter must be wired in series with the component that it is measuring.
## Voltmeter
A voltmeter measures the potential difference (voltage) across a component.
Voltage is measured in **volts (V).**
A voltmeter is always wired in parallel to the component that it is measuring.

## What are the missing words about circuits?
### Circuit 1, Series:
1. The current at different positions in the circuit, before and after the bulb, was **the same**
2. Therefore, the current **is not** used up by the components in the circuit
### Circuit 2, Parallel:
3. Increasing the number of components in the circuit **decreased** the current.
4. But the current at all points in a series circuit is still **the same**.
### Voltage in a series circuit
1. The current is the **flow** of electricity around the circuit.
2. The **supply voltage** is the amount of push.
3. When two components were put into circuit 2, the voltage of the supply was **the same as** circuit 1
### Cells in a series circuit
1. Increasing the number of cells increases the current that flows in the circuit.
2. The current flowing in the circuit depends on the voltage of the power supply
