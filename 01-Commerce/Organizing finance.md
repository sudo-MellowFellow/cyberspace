**How do you arrange money for business?**
Businesses need money to be able to operate and this money can come from one of two sources.
1. **Equity finance** - from withing the business itself where the owners or shareholders provide the *captial* needed to run the business from their own funds or using profits already earned. Sources of owner’s equity are therefore:
	* the owner’s savings or assets
	* retained profits of the business
2. **Debt finance** - funds borrowed from external parties (such as banks) that need to be repaid with interest. Sources of debt finance include:
	* *Term Loans* - loans for a fixed period of time to purchase assets such as machinery, computers, cars or inventory.
	* _Mortgages_ - the borrower provides property as security for a loan.
	* _Bank Overdrafts_ - a business has permission to overdraw the funds in their accounts up to a specified limit to help finance everyday payments.
	* _Credit Cards_ - issued by financial institutions to allow purchases to be made for payment at a later stage.
	* _Trade Credit_ - businesses buy goods and services on credit to the business where it will be paid back by a specified date in the future. It allows a business to sell the goods before they have paid for them.

Businesses will often _lease_ equipment or buy equipment through a _hire purchase agreement_ to avoid large upfront costs.
