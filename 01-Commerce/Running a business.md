An entrepreneur is a person who runs a business and in doing so, receives the profit (or loss) the business makes in the process. This is considered the return for the risk the entrepreneur takes and for organising the business activities.
## Starting from scratch
- Sometimes ==conditions are more favourable== for starting a new business than for buying an existing one, for example:
	- When a person has ==created something unique== and starts a business to market their innovation or invention
	- When a person ==recognises a gap in the market==, where it is clear that customers’ needs are not satisfied by existing businesses
	- When the ==market has grown== and existing businesses cannot supply all customers

| **Advantages**                                                             | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                            |

| The owner has the freedom to set up the business exactly as they wish. | There is a high risk and a measure of uncertainty. Without a previous business reputation, it may prove difficult to secure finance.     |
| There is no **goodwill** for which the owner has to pay.               | Time is needed to setup the businesses, create procedures, develop a customer base, employ and train staff, and develop lines of credit. |
| The owner is able to determine the pace of growth and change           | If the start-up period is slow, then the business may not generate profits for some time.                                                |
| If funds are limited, it is possible to begin on a smaller scale.      |                                                                                                                                          |
## Buying an existing business
- When an existing business is purchased, the business is already operating and everything associated with the business is included in the purchase, for example:
	- Stock and equipment
	- Premises
	- Existing customer base
	- Staff
	- Location 
	- Reputation and goodwill

| **Advantages**                                                        | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sales to existing customers will generate instant income.             | The existing image and policies of the business may be difficult to change, especially if the business had a poor reputation.             |
| A good business history increases the likelihood of business success, | The success of the business may have been due to the previous owner’s personality and contacts, so may be lost when the business is sold. |
| A proven track record makes it easier to obtain finance.              | It may be difficult to assess the value of goodwill, with the likelihood that the newcomer will pay more than it is worth.                |
| Stock has already been acquired and is ready for sale.                | There may be hidden problems                                                                                                              |
| The seller may offer advice and training.                             | Some employees may resent any change to the business operation.                                                                           |
| Equipment is available for immediate use.                             |                                                                                                                                           |
| Existing employees can provide valuable assistance.                   |                                                                                                                                           |
## Buying a franchise
- A franchise involves buying the rights from another business to distribute its products under its name.
- People choose to start a franchise in the hope of avoiding many of the problems associated with starting a new business.
- For a set fee, the small business owner receives the benefits of a successful business formula, a well-recognised name and established trademarks.

> [!Franchisor vs Franchisee]
> A ***franchisor*** is an individual or business that grants the right to others to use its name and supplies the products.
> 
> A ***franchisee*** is an individual or business that purchases the right and supplies the startup money and labour, operates the franchise business and agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement.

- List positives of owning a franchise
	- When you purchase a franchise it comes with all the goodwill built up by other instalments.
	- Well-planned advertising already exists and will continue to be made without need for your input.
	- Equipment and premises designs have already been created and only require setup.

* In a paragraph - Explain *WHY* franchises are a problem. (Consider this clue: explain this quote “franchisors are accountable to customers (and to shareholders) franchisees are accountable to employees (and the law).”)
Franchises split the responsibilities of a company between the franchisor and franchisee. This can create a rift if problems occur and is hard to pin the issues on any one side. Franchisor’s also keep all of the company’s stock and a percentage cut of the profits from each franchisee meaning the franchisee only has the job of running the storefront likely deeply reducing profits gained by the franchisee. This also means the franchisor takes almost no risk every time a new instalment is created putting almost all losses onto the franchisee, which still has to deal with some of the risks when beginning a new store.
