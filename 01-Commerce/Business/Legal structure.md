#### Private Franchising
In a franchise, an owner pays a company for the right to do business using that company’s products, services, and name. The parent company agrees to provide the owner with training, development, advertising and marketing support. While the name on the outside of the building is that of the parent company, the actual location is privately owned by an independent business owner.
>[!Note]
A company distributes its products and services through independent business

### Public companies
- **Public companies** are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.
- Anyone can buy and sell shares.
> [!Note] 
> A public company can have an unlimited number of shareholders. Most public companies are large. Shareholders in public companies have limited liability.
> 
> A public company must have the word “limited”, abbreviated to “Ltd”, after its name.

- **Government enterprises** are government-owned and operated businesses

## Business ownership
- ==Decide what form of business ownership is appropriate for:==
	- a small bicycle shop that offers personal and professional advice by the owner
		- The bicycle shop would be a sole trader. This is the cheapest and easiest business to setup and the owner wouldn’t likely need any other employees. There is unlikely to be too many tasks that the owner would not be able to handle on their own and it keeping it as a sole trader can help reduce the amount of tax needed to pay.
	- a national retail chain that would require $589 million to establish
		- A franchise is likely to be and would have to be a public company. This is due to it’s size and need for funding through shareholders. Being a public company it would be easier to manage the company due to its board of directors and numerous employees. With a greater spread of risk it is unlikely the company will fail or bankrupt, additionally if the business does fail the owner and business are separate legal entity meaning they have limited liability. With limited liability personal assets are not able to be repossessed.
	- a suburban hairdresser
		- A small hairdresser should be a partnership as it is unlikely to grow past the single shop. Partnerships allow the business to pool their skills and funding letting them efficiently run the small store. The extra hands will help keep work tied down and there wouldn’t be a need for more then 20 employees
