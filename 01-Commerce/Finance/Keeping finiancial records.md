# Cash flow statements
A cash flow statement indicates the movement of cash receipts (inflows – such as money from sales), and cash payments (outflows – such as payments for expenses), over a period of time.

By regularly comparing the totals of receipts and payments, a business is able to calculate its surplus or deficit of cash. This is an important indicator of a business’s liquidity – the ability of a business to pay its short-term debts on time.

> [!NOTE] COGS
> Costs of goods sold (COGS) = opening stock + purchases - closing stock
