In pairs, imagine that you and your friend have decided to go into business together. Create a NEW business and prepare a presentation on the following:

1. Business Name and logo.
Flot (Incorporated)
![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdz0sIQFA4tRdEpbSEXAjPoa-XSchd0ev_gqPGBoXyJXAM5fExF1M_00Hjsg6AiX4wlSWYja3Q3SqF4BHHLaY3snanC_2KX8Eln3yWPV9aWJ7k9hLkqTHuzKw2BVR53iPKTa2CO6ZwGw7tI_5l-0g-JKca3?key=q1t6kX6lR3vrWO5gIBT_aw)

2. Vision statement.
“To bring the mind to the cloud, connecting a manual today to an automatic tomorrow.”

3. Legal structure and justify
Private -> Public

We will start off as a private company as there will only be the two shareholders/owners. The business will start small, most likely operated from a personal residence (employees, server technology). We may need to take out business loans in order to purchase the technology and programming services required, and if it backfires we have a limited liability, in which only our company assets are liquidated, and not our personal assets. We would not start as a partnership; it reduces our businesses growth potential. We would need to hire some employees, or even increase shareholders in the business people which have the required skill sets in order to ensure that business operations would run smoothly. Our end goal will be to become a large public company, which we will reach by starting as a smaller private company then once we have raised enough capital we will enter the stock market and go public in order to gain greater capital to eventually build our own data centres and upgrade our old systems to keep our vision statement.

4. What products and services do you provide? List at least 5 products.
- Data profiling service
	- Sort the data into neat profile packages which can then be analysed by consumer companies and used for advertisement and product promotion purposes.
- Data collecting algorithms
	- Base service and main purpose of the company, which scans and collects data from public records
- Enterprise Server Security
	- Securing other companies servers from hackers and data breaches, including secure and airtight encryption services
- Surveillance Solutions
	- Advanced net filtering utilising artificial intelligence to filter out unsafe content on-the-fly, reporting websites deemed unsafe/explicit/deemed unnecessary to the enterprise/government agency/educational institution in question.
- Worker Watcher 3000
	- Worker surveillance solution to ensure that workers are staying productive, loyal and not unionising.
	- Heat Mapping to effectively monitor worker location without invading privacy using security cameras
	- Employee Profiling 
		- Internet usage in and out of the workplace (hobbies, interests, skill sets, efficiency)
		- Time spent at the workplace actually working (how much one gets done in their working hours
		- Tracking bathroom breaks

5. Name 2 other competitors and how are they different from you.
- Epsilon
- Acxiom

6. Product differentiation - How are you different from your competitor?

7. Where will your store be located and justify your location.
Since, to begin, it will not be a physical store where consumers can purchase goods, it will be located at one of our personal residences (the server technology) and on the cloud (for purchasing services via digital transactions). Once the business has grown in which it is no longer viable to remain at a personal residence, such as additional shareholders/employees, an increasing amount of server and data storage technology and an eventual increase in capital, the headquarters would eventually be moved to a major business district, such as Sydney (the central business district). This HQ would house offices and other business departments (customer service, data storage, technology development, etc). 

8. Create an advertisement/poster for your products on social media.
