# Product promotion
- **Promotion:** methods used by a business to *inform*, *persuade* and *remind* customers about its product
- The aims of a promotion:
	- Introduce a new product
	- Sell more of an exiting product
	- Attract new customers
	- Demonstrate the advantages of one product over alternatives.

> [!NOTE] New products
> Do not sell products that have been already created. These products don't sell well due to them already being in the market (if done in the assessment you will lose all your marks)
