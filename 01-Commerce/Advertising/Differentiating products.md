Differentiation occurs when products (goods or services) that are the same or similar are made to  
appear different from and/or better than those of their competitors. By listing the  
differences between one product and another, a business (seller) is simply trying to make  
its product more desirable to consumers. The following factors are often used to  
differentiate products
- Customer Service
- Convenience
- Environmental Friendliness
- Value for Money
- Being socially and ethically responsible
- Price 
- Quality
- Packaging
# Product positioning
Product positioning refers to the creation of a product image in the minds of consumers compared with the image of competing products. It aims to create positive impressions. Eg. when you imagine the brand Ferrari, you immediately think of positive characteristics including, fast, luxurious, popular etc.
# Situation analysis (SWOT)
The business should examine the market situation and look at any factors that are in their control and those that they are not entirely in control of. A *SWOT Analysis* is often used by businesses to examine these factors outlining:
- **Strengths** - what the business does well
- **Weaknesses** - what the business needs to improve
- **Opportunities** - what is occurring outside the business that can improve the businessâ€™ success Eg. new technologies, increase in international trade
- **Threats** - what can have a negative impact on the business that they have limited control over Eg. economic downturn, new competitors, new laws.
