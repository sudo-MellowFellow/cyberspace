*Write a summary of one of the extracts. (1984)*

In 1984, Winston Smith lived in the future where every movement and through was watched and controlled by the party. The Party watches these people through the use of Telescreens, a device that can be dimmed but never shut off making sure it can monitor your every move, alongside this is the omnipresent posters which declare “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU”.

Even though every move and sound Winston makes is tracked by the Telescreens he still manages to make small rebellions. Rebellions such as his ownership of a diary which he writes in. If caught by the thought police it was likely Winston would be punished with death or at least twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.

By the end of the chapter Winston begins to gain free thought, with this he worries about the mixing of time where days and years are no longer tracked. Leaving us worried if he will get caught by the thought police as he panically writes in his illegal diary.
