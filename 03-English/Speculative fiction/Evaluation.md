Dear Mr. George Orwell, (isn’t he dead)

Your piece 1984 is incredibly important when discussing freedom in the future and ensuring technology isn’t used as an iron fist over the general public. Its use of words allows you to be easily immersed in the world and much of the dystopian society is easily believed. Every piece of technology could be made quite quickly and the political leadership of the world could easily fall into place. The story could turn from dystopia to reality quite quickly if the leaders of our world aren’t kept in check, which is why I believe this book to be so important with its look at the future and what it might become. This is also the case with many of the dystopian aspects of your book going hand in hand with reality, examples include the Chinese and their authoritarian political system, the USA and their endless wars to keep their businesses running.
