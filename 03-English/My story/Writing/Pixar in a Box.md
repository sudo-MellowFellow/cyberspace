1. What have humans been doing since “before we could speak”?
Humans have been telling stories to connect with others

2. What is the power of stories?
Stories allow people to connect on an emotional level 

3. What does “write what you know” mean according to the video?
Put parts of your life (experiences) into the story, don’t literally write about your life. Writing about things that might seem boring to you can be interesting to others and experiences are easy to be interested in.
E.G. If you are becoming a dad write about a monster who has to struggle with a child becoming it’s father/guardian.

4. What makes ‘a boring car chase’ come alive?
Add weight to the chase and feelings from characters within the chase. Write concrete feelings not abstract instead of he felt scared (which is unique per person), write his knuckles turned white as he held onto the steering wheel (which is concrete and everyone would think the same thing).

5. Pitch (create) a story idea where you combine something fantastical with something ordinary (like a monster who has a day job).
A mail man in a nuclear wasteland having to fight off monsters

6. Do stories come out perfectly for the Pixar director? How can we apply this to writing our own stories?
No he has to re-write and edit over and over before the story becomes good. We can apply this by constantly building on stories and try again and again.
