1. What makes a place feel like home to you? Is it the physical space or the people and experiences within it? (300 words)

A house simple just a place to live, a physical place you can come back to everyday. A home on the other hand is complex a mix of people and feelings and experiences that changes and transforms a house into a home.

What makes your house a home?

Is it the place, the physical location? The outside standing strong, being resilient while the inside is soft and kind, like an oyster. If you had no set space as your house, would you still have a home, no physical place could you still have a home?

Castles can be homes, so can communities.

Describing a house is easy just a place where you can live. That can be a house, an apartment, a library even. A home on the other hand isn’t just a place you can live; it doesn’t have a well know definition. Many would believe their house is their home, perhaps it is but others can find more comfort in more diverse places.

Homes are more about the feelings linked to areas or people. For some communities can be their home, a student might feel at home with their class. A bookworm can feel at home in the library or in a reading circle. Experiences can also make an area into a home, hanging out in an area and having good times with friends will make these places feel more like home.

Where do you feel at home? Where is this home?

For me, my home isn’t the physical space it’s the people inside and all the feelings that come with them. The safety, warmth, and truth make my house a home.

My home is wherever my family is. With my dog, with my friends. Finding my home took time and once it was found it took a long time for my home to become cozy and relaxed. My family always help everything feel right at home, a sense of security.

I wonder where yours is.
