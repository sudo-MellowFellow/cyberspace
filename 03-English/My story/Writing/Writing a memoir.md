Choosing an artefact: My dog

Sat in-front of my TV, holding my dog in my lap, he lays there and yawns. A warm dark circle, soft and cute. He showed me how affection runs after long years of confusion, I felt certainty in meeting the most important figure within my life. On my lap I feel his soft coat like a fluffy mat, curled up with his head next to his tail and looking like a dark ring.

I remember how I got him, through dark times of divorce. Love felt painful and I was confused. No anchor to hold the world and slowly falling I never knew what was happening, but life wasn’t enjoyable. I was simply a child struggling though early primary school and all I wanted was someone to embrace. 

He came to me in a handbag, introduced in turmoil and bringing balance. The light in the dark, the yin to my yang. He looked like a black hole unable to be photographed and often hidden in the dark. Scared, hiding and tiny but I loved him and he loved me. 

Staying close together we went through growth, growing slowly, becoming more certain. Our feelings tender and isolation far off. My dog, always a puppy in my mind, playful and a big spirit but still being small.

I feel the warmth in my heart as I pat him, feeling safe. When I’m with him life comes back as though embracing someone you cherish deeply. We become attached with love and happiness forging the bond for life. Untouchable by the world, our feelings strong enough to live forever. These feelings eclipse my being. No matter what, we would love each other.

Snacks, walks and my attention is all he seeks, staying close and loving. I taught him tricks to play and the patience to stay in my lap. Sitting with him while relaxing, holding him while feeling down. 

Times could be hard but they would never be overwhelming with my little dog. Sitting with him and feeling calm, relaxing in-front of my TV.
