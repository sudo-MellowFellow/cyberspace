# Isolated and disorientated
I think I want to do aging or being lost. Instance time by pink Floyd watching time fly without going anywhere

The idea of having no goals, no aspirations, and no drive.
Floating without direction through life

Rain blasted Terry as he stood outside. Street lights illuminated him, shining off of his luggage. A white townhouse stood in front of him, filled with memories now flattened by his broken heart. He had spent years with this girl, but the house of cards fell with only one blow. Losing his job seemed to break apart his entire life. Until this moment drifting through life had always worked out, the winds blew the right ways.

With no friends left, Terry had to turn to the only one’s left. His parents. 

Coming back home was
# The future on paper
Self expression and creativity
It could be about me and my drive to create art but finding it hard.
Extended metaphor about me being a blank piece of paper.
## Exemplifies the drawing
Sunlight flowed through the window onto the paper. Its white expanse taunting me. I stared down at it, trying to think. I know what I’ve got to, draw this lady, simple and fast. Still I’ve been staring at this paper for three days already, the deadline had gone from clouds in the distance to a storm cloud fast approaching with only three nights left.

My fingers ran across the paper, smooth and uncaring it seems indifferent about what’s on it. Though almost yearns for something to be on it and doesn’t mind what I put onto it. Yet I keep thinking trying to plan how to start. Times seems to slow down as I continue thinking. Still yet to begin my drawing I get up for a break. 

There is no difficulty in erasing the content on the paper but difficulty comes from not having anything to erase and improve. 
## Exemplifies the future
Sunlight flowed through the window onto my paper. It’s white expanse tauntingly shining at me. I watched it, staring. I wished that some sort of masterpiece would materialize on it. I sit almost paralyzed as I continue to think about what sort of masterpiece it would be. An astronaut being the first to Mars? The man to cure cancer? World’s fastest racer? Never did these things come to fruition. The future of this paper could be anything. Yet it still isn’t going anywhere, nothing happens while I think, what ifs can never get me anywhere the only way to move forwards is to begin. Set my feet down and begin the crawl towards a masterwork.

I slowly run my fingers across my paper, it’s smooth and indifferent. These imaginary futures had no effect on it, it didn’t care what I hoped and wished for. There would be no change until I began making one. I remember how I ended up in this art course, following passions to the happiness forever on the horizon.

I always had a love for art, drawing and creation was the most fun activity that has ever been offered to me. Yet it took years before I actually began to get into it. Seems almost counter intuitive that you don’t do lots of the things that make you happy. Still this was the way it was, until I brought in changes. I stopped holding myself from pursuing passions just to try fit in with social groups. The mistakes I made while emerging were all temporary but the happiness and enjoyment I have gained from pursuing this hobby was forever.

My artwork now is the same. Until I stop thinking about starting and actually get into it, no change will ever be made. Paralysis of the future. That’s what I’ve always liked to call it, stopping myself from progressing due to my worries and what ifs. What if this didn’t come out perfect? What if I fail? What if… All of this thinking and none of it matters. Things will never be perfect but if I start now there will be time to review, revise and improve it until it becomes a masterwork. The same applies for failing, the only failure is if nothing is created. Because a misshapen sketch or half written sentence is a testament to the courage to try. It’s a mark on the blank page of existence, that you dared to dream, dared to fail, dared to exist.

I pick up my pen and begin to draw. Lines appear, some wobbly, some bold, each one a step forward. The future will come. It will be nasty. But it is not written in advance. Nobody makes my fate but me.
