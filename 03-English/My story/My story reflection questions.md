# Reflection questions
## Question: 1
My work explores the themes of creativity and overcoming the fear of starting.  These are shown in various sections where the narrative delves into the paralysing nature of “what ifs” that can hinder action on different projects/ideas. These themes resonated deeply with me because I personally struggle with starting projects due to the fear that my work won't be perfect, which can typically lead to procrastination. The theme of creativity also means something to me as I'm an artist so often create different creative works similar to the protagonist within the story. 
## Question: 2
C → Concept statement that responds to the question and references a model text.
Q → Quote yourself.
T → Technique/feature - how you have used the same feature as the model text.
E → Effect of using that feature (what were you trying to achieve?)

My piece utilises an extended metaphor of a blank page representing my potential and the future. Similar to how the masala in “Masala of my Soul” represents the complex flavours of life, the blank page becomes a canvas for the various possibilities of my future. Quotes like “The future of this paper could be anything. Yet it still isn’t going anywhere, nothing happens while I think, what ifs can never get me anywhere the only way to move forwards is to begin” illustrates this metaphor. This extended metaphor not only makes the themes of overcoming the fear of starting and embracing creativity relatable, but also offers a clear and engaging way to showcase the internal struggles faced by the character.
## Question: 3
Explain what you did initially
The largest change within my story was my extended metaphor. In my original piece the story centred more around the artwork and had a storm as the metaphor, the storm was both a metaphor of the incoming deadline and the future. This storm was literally approaching my work station through the story, which progressively got closer as I procrastinated.
What changed? Quote yourself/give an example
To improve on the extended metaphor, I decided to remove the storm and convert the artwork into a similar idea of the storm. That being of a fast approaching future and my fear of starting due to think I couldn’t outrun the storm. This idea is shown in the quote, “The future of this paper could be anything. Yet it still isn’t going anywhere.”. It shows how the future has uncapped potential, but I still hadn’t begun due to my worry of it not coming out perfectly. 
***Why?***
I changed the metaphor as the storm didn’t relate closely to the artwork which was the main conflict in the story. In addition, having a blank sheet as the metaphor tied well into the themes of creativity due to many creatives beginning with a blank sheet which you expand ideas onto.
