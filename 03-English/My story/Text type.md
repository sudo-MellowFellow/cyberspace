You need to review the conventions and structural features of persuasive, discussive and imaginative texts, ensure you are familiar with the text type you choose.
# Persuasive
A text designed to convince a reader of a particular opinion or way of thinking on an issue. A persuasive text may express an opinion while discussing, analysing and/or evaluating an issue.

Feature may include: alliteration, anecdotes, rhetorical questions, emotive language, contrast, anaphora, modality.

Remember the pillars of persuasion (ethos, pathos, logos.)
* Ethos - Credibility (your doctor/dentist made a recommendation)
* Pathos - Emotions (appeals to emotions)
* Logos - Logic (appeal to sense, the logical thing to do)

# Discursive
Texts whose primary focus is to explore an idea or variety of topics. These texts involve the discussion of an idea(s) or opinion(s) without the direct intention of persuading the reader, listener or viewer to adopt any single point of view.

Features may include: anecdote, first person POV, thoughtful/reflective/conversational tone, figurative language devices, a balance of formal and informal language, references to popular culture, colloquialisms.
# Imaginative
Texts that represent ideas, feelings and mental images in words or visual images. Imaginative texts entertain or provoke thought through their creative use of literary elements and make connections between ideas and experiences.

Features may include: linear narrative, non-linear narrative, figurative language devices, characterisation, underlying themes.

You are not limited to writing a “story”. Consider journal/diaries, poetry, letters/correspondence.
# Hybrid texts
Composite texts resulting from combining elements from different genres, styles and modes.

# Reflection questions and backwards planning
Look at the reflection questions. 

Identify what it is you need to ensure you include in your text in order to answer these questions successfully.

Revisit the reflection questions as part of the editing process. If it is difficult for you to answer the questions, then you are not meeting the requirements for Part B OR Part A.
